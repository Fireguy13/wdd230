                            <p>Local History of Carlsbad California “The Village By The Sea”
                                Carlsbad’s earliest residents were the  Luiseño Indians who settled the coastal
                                area. The Luiseño
                                people were successful in living off the land using a number of natural resources to
                                provide food
                                and clothing. They had a close relationship with their natural environment. They used
                                many of the
                                native plants, harvesting many kinds of seeds, berries, nuts, fruits, and vegetables for
                                a varied
                                and nutritious diet. The land also was inhabited by many different species of animals
                                which the men
                                hunted for game and skins. Hunters took antelopes, bobcats, deer, elk, foxes, mice,
                                mountain lions,
                                rabbits, wood rats, river otters, ground squirrels, and a wide variety of insects. These
                                Native
                                Americans people were here at the time of the first contacts with the Spanish in the
                                16th century.
                                The Spanish missions in California comprise a series of 21 religious outpost
                                were established
                                between 1769 and 1833. The missions led to the creation of the New Spain province
                                of Alta
                                California and were part of the expansion of the Spanish Empire into the most northern
                                and western
                                parts of Spanish North America.
                                In 1821, Mexico achieved independence from Spain, taking Alta California along with it,
                                but the
                                missions maintained authority over native people and control of land holdings until the
                                1830s. The
                                Alta California government secularized the missions after the passage of the Mexican
                                secularization
                                act of 1833. This divided the mission lands into land grants, which became many of
                                the Ranchos of
                                California. During the Mexican period, in 1842, the southern portion of Carlsbad, was
                                granted
                                as Rancho Agua Hedionda to Juan María Marrón.

                                In the 1882 Captain John Frazier dug a well near the coast in Carlsbad. He began
                                offering his water
                                at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier’s Station. A test
                                done on a
                                second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in
                                some of the
                                most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in
                                the Bohemian town of
